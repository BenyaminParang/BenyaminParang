### Hi! I'm Benyamin Parang.

I grew up in Bushehr in the south of Iran. I have always
been enthusiatic about software development and working with
computers trying to figure out what's going on underneath.
Although I studied Electrical engineering at university, my
passion for learning programming never disappeared, and I
tried to change my direction towards it occasionally.

Iâ€™m currently learning front-end development focusing on
Javascript fundamentals and ReactJS.
